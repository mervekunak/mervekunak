### Hiii!! ðŸ‘‹
### I am Merve.

##  



A little bit about me:

I am 25 years old and from Ankara, Turkey. \smallskip
I would say I am a curious, social and a fun person apart from my analytical abilities.

I got my B.S. digree in Physics from Bilkent University in 2019. 
While studying physics I became interested in bio-physics and started my masters degree in Koc Univeresity in Bio-Medical Sciences and Engineering program where I was introduced to Linux and carried out molecular dynamics simulations.

I love to ski, watch tennis and spend time with my family & friends.
